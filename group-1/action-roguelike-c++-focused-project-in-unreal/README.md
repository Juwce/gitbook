# Action Roguelike (C++ Focused Project in Unreal)

Action Roguelike is a C++ focused (limited use of Blueprints) Unreal Engine project I developed during Tom Looman's [professional game development in C++ and Unreal Engine course](https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp). This course was taught at Stanford in 2020 (and now available online to anyone) and is an intense, in-depth project based course that dives deep into developing games professionally in C++, with Unreal Engine as the underlying engine.

This project covers working with a broad range of Unreal's underlying systems in C++, as well as developing new frameworks, interfaces, and gameplay mechanics in C++ from scratch. It covers things like networked game logic, behavior trees, a gameplay ability framework, physics, working with materials/shaders, UI management, saving and loading, and more with varying levels of depth. This section of my site is dedicated to explaining the project and its core systems in detail.

Please note that this project is a mix of code I wrote myself during assignments as well as course-provided code. While the hardest bits were left up to the assignments, not all of the code contained in the project is my own. Please see the page [assignments-c++.md](c++-course/assignments-c++.md "mention") for an overview of the specific parts of the project I developed entirely on my own. _However_, I should note that during the course I paid special attention to ensuring I gained a deep understanding of _every_ line of code provided by the class. I took this course for my own learning and with an intense curiosity to learn everything I could about developing games professionally in C++. In many cases I have re-written course-provided code to be up to my own standards.
