# Favorite Games

## Single Player Games

* Bethesda Softworks games (Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas)
  * These games hold a special place in my heart
  * Oblivion made me want to make games. The fact that these games are _still_ the only fully realized immersive RPG-sim worlds in gaming is one of my core motivations for learning game development. I want more.
* Monster Hunter Series
  * I've been playing it forever, but MH: World absolutely blew me away.
* Souls Series (Dark Souls 1 and 3, Elden Ring)
* Nier Automata
  * I get bored with single player, story driven RPGs very easily. Most don't last me more than a couple hours before I give up. Stories in modern games just don't hit me like I remember games did as a kid and end up feeling in the way of the gameplay. I kept hearing about this game, to the point where I decided to give it a shot and... this became one of my favorite games of all time. The story is expertly crafted (and a bit out there I'll admit) and has twist after twist that you genuinely won't see coming. One of my favorite things about this game was how the story twists had just as significant gameplay consequences, totally changing the core mechanics of the game in surprising ways that remained incredibly fun to match major story changes.
* Ratchet and Clank: A Rift Apart
  * World's first playable Pixar movie.
* Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  * I played this one on a free trial just to "see what Assassin's Creed was up to these days" after being disinterested in the series for a while (AC: Brotherhood was the last one I played at this point). Fifteen minutes in and I was hooked. There's something about the colorful Mediterranean, goofy and way overacted story, and simple but satisfying combat and exploration here that kept me hooked from start to finish on this one.
  * AC: Origins and Valhalla, while having the same basic game structure, didn't capture me in the same way.
* Slay the Spire
  * This game is to me what Solitaire is to some of my relatives. Endlessly replayable and doesn't require much brain power. Perfect for when you're feeling burnt out and need a mental break, or need to kill time in a public setting without getting sucked into a game.

### Multiplayer Games (Competitive)

* Call of Duty (Modern Warfare 2020, Cold War, Vanguard)
  * I picked Call of Duty back up after a several year drought with Modern Warfare 2020 and have been loving it ever since. The game _feels_ so good to play. For such a fast-paced game I find it oddly relaxing, and this has been my go-to take a break and wind-down game for a couple of years.
  * Cross play is really nice for switching between convenient and relaxed couch gaming on console and active and tight mouse and keyboard gaming on PC.
  * Zombies: Outbreak was the single best thing to ever happen to zombies.
  * While I burned out on Vanguard initially (guns were great, but the 24/7 maps Das Haus and Shipment didn't have the same endless fun-factor that Shoot House and Nuketown had for me in MW 2020 and Cold War respectively), Vanguard's arms race mode brought it back up to Modern Warfare levels of fun for me and I now play it regularly just for that mode. I love the high health pools, long range battles, and how balanced it generally feels. I've been having a lot of fun revisiting all the weapons to make them effective with higher health pools and at longer ranges too.
* Overwatch
  * Similar to CoD this game feels _great_ to play mechanically.
  * It's pretty. A "nice place to be in".
  * Just enough hero and playstyle variety to never get old for me.
  * Lots of opportunities to "outsmart" your opponents even if you're not the best mechanically. While fun, I struggle with games like CS:GO where I feel skill-capped by my twitch-aiming abilities. With Overwatch I feel like I can consistently beat players with better aim by having a better game sense.
  * The group chat feature is surprisingly fun and generally really friendly (in my games, at least). Funny conversations with your team and the enemy team usually offset the frustration of a loss (usually :smile:).
* Battlefield V
  * I love the tactics of this game. Your game and map sense matter so much more than your mechanical ability.
  * Lots of opportunities for antics when I'm not feeling very competitive (the bayonet is my favorite).
  * That said, it still feels great to play. They got the shooting right in this game.
  * Great selection of maps, modes and weapons.
  * Still rewards me for upgrading to the latest graphics card years after release

### **Multiplayer Games (with Friends)**

* Borderlands 3
  * This game is the most fun I've ever had playing with a group of friends. It struck the perfect balance of controls, loot, and graphics for me. The legendary weapon grind towards the end was a blast.
  * A great reason to buy an OLED TV. The lighting and HDR implementation are excellent and really bring the unique art style to life.
* Divinity: Original Sin 2
  * Few story-driven games are designed well for drop-in drop-out multiplayer with friends. For me this game must be played with friends.
* Golf with your Friends
  * Best mini golf game.
