<img src=".gitbook/assets/me.jpg" alt="" data-size="original">&#x20;

Welcome to my site! I am an experienced Software Engineer and Technical Product Manager passionate about video games and entrepreneurship.&#x20;

I am currently taking a few months off of work to learn the skills necessary to work professionally in the video game industry, and this site serves as a demonstration of and documentation for everything I have learned about making games so far.

**Why Switch Careers to Games?**

My two passions have always been video games and entrepreneurship. In college I picked my major, Computer Science, knowing nothing about it except that I could hopefully learn how video games work under the hood. But when I finally graduated college with a degree in Computer Science (and specialization in computer graphics) I was torn. I loved games and had learned the fundamentals of how they work under the hood but was not sure if the games industry was right for me. I ultimately decided on a software engineering job outside of the games industry. However, making games has stayed in the back of my mind since. In the past couple years, I picked up the games industry podcast: "[The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-aias-game-makers-notebook/id1313004515)". It's a treasure trove of hundreds and hundreds of interviews with games industry leaders covering how they got their start in games, how their careers have progressed, discussing in detail important topics like "crunch", and much more. Over many months of listening to dozens of hours of interviews, the conversations I heard and things I learned in this podcast had me convinced: I would love to work in the games industry, given the opportunity to work at the right studio and in the right role. A few months ago, I found myself between jobs deciding what to do next. I was going to spend the next few months learning the ins-and-outs of making video games professionally (in C++) with the goal of getting a great first job in the industry.

**Outside Interests**

I love gaming, learning new skills and perspectives from non-fiction books, travel, various forms of exercise and getting outdoors.
